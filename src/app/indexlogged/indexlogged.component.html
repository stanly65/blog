          <p>
            There's been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing. Simpe a it
            seem, the excitement Sci-Fi Today, Reality TV Tomorrow, at least for me, stems for how the feat has
            brought one step closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies-etched into our minds by the many
            blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced. If you can recall one of the opening scenes or The
            Martian, we witnessed the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifing off, attemping to escape an ensuing dust
            storm. While most of the focus was on the misfortune of Mark Watney - played by Matt Daamon, left
            behind after being struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily the MAV ascended
            into space. Combine the thought of how the MAV got there in the first place, and you have yourself a
            similar parallel to SpaceX launch and landing. So what am I getting at? Science fiction only remains
            science fiction until technology catches up with our imagination. The applies not just to space
            travel, but every other area of technological asvancment.
